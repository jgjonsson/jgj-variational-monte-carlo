# Problem2b implementation

Problem 2b was about implementing the necessary classes for the Restricted Boltzmann Machine type of wave function, plus updating the gradient descent and start experimenting with learning rate. 

# Building the code
If run from the root directory of the Git-repo, the build commands are:

```
make app=Project-2/Problem-1b/unit_tests
make app=Project-2/Problem-1b/single_particle 
make app=Project-2/Problem-1b/large_simulation
```

# Running tests

To run the unit tests, run this program:
```
bin/Project-2/Problem-1b/unit_tests.out
```

No parameter needed. It runs some tests, print various output, and if everything is ok ends with the line: All tests passed!

# Running simulations
